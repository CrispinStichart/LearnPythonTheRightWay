I suggest narrowing your browser window for a better reading experience -- personally, I think the default width of the rendered markdown is too wide.

Start with `lectures/section 1/lesson 1 -- Introduction.md`

The `cliche_detector.md` lesson was written for my English-teacher roommate, but I might work it in to the main course somewhere.
