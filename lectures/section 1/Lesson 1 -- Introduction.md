# How to Learn Programming (the Right Way™)

## Who You Are
You are a person who has never touched a programming language before, or has tried to learn in the past but didn't see much success. You may consider yourself a computer nerd, or you may have no familiarity with computers beyond the basics of browsing the web and writing Word documents. This course assumes nothing about previous programming experience, and very little about your level of computing skills.

## Who I am
I am software developer who graduated with a CS degree five years ago, but has been coding for at least ten years.  I say "at least" because I started very gradually, and learned in fits and starts. I was never a prodigy that understood everything about programming the moment I was introduced to it, and I don't expect you to be, either.

## Why This Course Exists
Recently I've been working as an online tutor for entry-level programming courses, and I've come to a conclusion: the way programming is being taught, in many universities around the world, is *wrong*. There is no single right way to teach a person to program, but there are clearly many bad ways. In my hubris, I believe that I can create an entire Computer Science 101 course that is better than the majority of offerings out there.

## How This Course is Structured
The lectures are organized into *sections*. In a traditional University course, each section would be about a week's worth of content. I don't want to name them as such, because:
1. I don't know for sure that they're a week's worth of content; this course has not been tried in a traditional classroom setting
2. I don't want you to feel pressured to learn at a particular pace. Take your time!

## What This Course Expects of You
Each lecture contains examples and small assignments based around the topics being discussed. You are not expected to passively read these lectures. You *must* be simultaneously running the examples, attempting the exercises, and verifying everything you read. If I tell you that `1 + 1` is `2`, don't take it for granted -- run that code and see for yourself!

At the end of each section is a project assignment that will tie together everything from that sections' lectures. These project assignments will build on each other. You'll keep coming back to the code you wrote and adding features and improving it, and by the end of the course, you'll have a fully featured program, that is 100% built by you from the ground up.

# Is This Actually the One True Right Way™ to Learn Programming?
No. Despite the name, there are many good ways to learn programming. The field of Computer Science is an ocean, both broad and deep. You could start from the deepest, darkest ocean depths by learning how electricity works, and building a computer chip from first principles. If this sounds appealing, check out [NAND to Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/).

Or you frolic with the fishes in a Caribbean lagoon by learning Scheme, which until recently was how MIT taught their programming fundamentals course. If this sounds interesting, check out the classic textbook they used, [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_and_Interpretation_of_Computer_Programs).

I'm going to abandon the ocean metaphor now, but my point is that you could start anywhere and succeed. Everyone's different, and everyone has their own mix of brain chemistry and personal experiences that makes one method of learning more viable than another.

If you struggle with this course, you're not dumb, you just need to come at it from a different angle. The two angles mentioned above are both a bit extreme, in different ways. More realistic alternative approaches include [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and just searching on YouTube for ["how to program"](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+program). 

# Okay, What Next?
Next... dive in! This was Lesson 1 of Section 1, so continue on to Lesson 2 of Section 1, and let's start coding!
